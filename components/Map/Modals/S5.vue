          The Horyn River is where the German troops entered the town of Tuchyn
          in July 1941. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941,
          and so invaded the region where Tuchyn sat. Violence was especially
          brutal on this Eastern Front because Nazis viewed Jews and communists
          as their main enemies. So, for the Jewish population of Tuchyn, the
          German invasion of the communist Soviet Union meant a series of
          extremely harsh, violent, and antisemitic policies.

            The Germans sought the destruction of the Soviet Union. But, in
            1941, Germany’s Chancellor Adolf Hitler shifted policy from the
            extreme persecution of Jews to a policy of mass murder. Hitler and
            the Nazi Party began planning the extermination of all Eastern
            European Jews.

            When the Germans arrived, many Jews felt terror and families looked
            for places to hide. Jewish families left their homes and fled to the
            edge of the city. The Ukraninans welcomed the Germans with open
            arms, sometimes even yelling “Death to the Jews.” Luba Chomut
            recalled that a week after the Germans arrived there was a pogrom in
            which Ukrainian gangs killed members of the Jewish community and
            attacked Luba and her mother.
