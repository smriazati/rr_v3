            This site marks a boundary of the Tuchyn ghetto, a part of town
            where German officials forced the Jewish community to live. The
            ghetto was made up of about 50 small homes and was very crowded, as
            many Jews had come there from nearby villages. During the Holocaust,
            the Germans created thousands of ghettos across Eastern Europe.

            The ghetto in Tuchyn was an “open ghetto,” meaning people could come
            and go somewhat easily. Getzel Shwartzman and the Judenrat, with the
            aid of bribes, stalled the establishment of a formal, enclosed
            ghetto until early September 1942.

          The German administration also abolished elements of Jewish life such
          as Jewish schools, cultural activities, medical services, and
          religious practice. They ordered Jews to surrender their homes and
          belongings and forced them to supply labor to the war effort.
          Eventually, ghettos were eliminated, as Jewish people were murdered
          outright in their own communities or deported to concentration and
          extermination camps.
